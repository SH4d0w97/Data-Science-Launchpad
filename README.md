## 🚀 Data Science Launchpad: Real-World E-Commerce Analysis

### 👋 Introduction

Welcome! This repository is designed to be a **hands-on guide** for anyone who wants to transition from "learning syntax" to "doing data science."
Instead of boring exercises, we are going to analyze a real dataset of 100,000+ e-commerce orders to answer actual business questions.

### 📊 Dataset Used

The project is built around the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset**. This relational dataset allows us to practice multi-table joins and realistic business logic.

### 🛠️ What You Will Learn

* **Data Engineering:** How to set up a SQLite database and load raw CSV data using Python.
* **SQL:** Writing complex queries with **JOINs**, **aggregations**, and advanced logic like **CTEs**.
* **Python Analysis:** Connecting SQL to **Pandas** for data manipulation.
* **Visualization:** Creating charts to tell a story with data.

### 📂 Project Structure / Syllabus

* **Module 1: Environment Setup** - Installing tools and loading the data.
* **Module 2: SQL Deep Dive** - Understanding the schema and writing the queries (Files: `sql_basics.py`, `task_joins.py`).
* **Module 3: Analysis & Visualization** - Finding insights and plotting results.

### 💻 Getting Started (Installation Instructions)
